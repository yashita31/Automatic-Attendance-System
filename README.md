# Automatic-Attendance-System
An Open CV project which uses Facial Recognition to keep a record of Studentâ€™s Attendance. In real-time, this model is integrated with the academic timetable to detect a student's face and mark his attendance for the respective subject. Some insights are also provided using the Pandas package: Students with attendance of less than 75%.
